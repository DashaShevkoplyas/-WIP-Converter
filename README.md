# Converter
This app will be using open API for convertation of mp4 to gif. Creating it as additional utility for purposes when there is a need to upload a live-represenation of the bug occures and JIRA not accepting mp4 format.
That will simplify a bit the process reducing the time needed to manually convert it.
